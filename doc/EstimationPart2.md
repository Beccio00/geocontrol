# Project Estimation part 2



Goal of this document is to compare actual effort and size of the project, vs the estimates made in task1.
Report, as by the following instructions, actual size and effort at the end the project on june 7, 
excluding containerization (include task1, task2, task 3, exclude task 4).

# Computation of size

# Computation of effort 

# Computation of productivity

productivity = ((LOC of production code)+ (LOC of test code)) / effort


# Comparison

|                                        | Estimated (end of task 1) | Actual (june 7, end of task 3)|
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |----|
| size  |||
| effort |||
| productivity  | 10 loc / hour ||

Report, as estimate of size, 
Report, as estimate of effort, the value obtained via activity decomposition technique

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
