# Integration approach

  L'approccio utilizzato Ã¨ bottom up guardando in maniera indipendente la logica per i sensori, gateway, network, misure,autenticazione e utenti. 
  
  Quindi per ogniuno di essi abbiamo seguito il seguente approccio: 

  step 1: unit test del repository
  step 2: integration test repository e controller
  step 3: e2e test

    <Write here the integration sequence you adopted, in general terms (top down, bottom up, mixed) and as sequence

    (ex: step1: unit A, step 2: unit A+B, step 3: unit A+B+C, etc)>

    <Some steps may  correspond to unit testing (ex step1 in ex above)>

    <One step will  correspond to API testing, or testing unit route.js>

# Tests
